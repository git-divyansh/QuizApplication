# Quiz Application

This is a fully functional quiz application built using React.js. The application allows users to take timed quizzes, select multiple answers, and receive a detailed result analysis upon submission. It supports scoring based on correct, incorrect, and partially correct answers and displays results using a pie chart.

## Features

- **Timed Quizzes**: Users can set a timer for the quiz, specifying hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Supports single and multiple selection of answers.
- **Partial Scoring**: If one of the selected answers is correct and others are wrong, the user will receive half of the marks for that question.
- **Auto-submit on Timer Expiry**: Automatically submits the quiz when the timer reaches zero.
- **Result Analysis**: Displays a pie chart with the results, showing how many questions were:
  - Correct (Green)
  - Wrong (Red)
  - Partially Correct (Yellow)
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
